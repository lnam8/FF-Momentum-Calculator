The Python file in this directory will make a one-time call to the Sleeper API and will append the projected point and statistical outputs for the request players to `season_projections.csv`.

The players that these projections will be populated for are:
- Puka Nacua
- Kyle Pitts
- Josh Jacobs
- Calvin Ridley
- Raheem Mostert
- Zach Ertz

## Usage

```bash
python3 season_projections.py
```

As this is a run-once only script, the code that appends the data to a CSV has been commented out.
